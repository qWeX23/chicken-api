Welcome to the Chicken API! This project is a fun, open-source API for all things chicken. Whether you're a developer looking for a unique API to integrate into your project, or a chicken enthusiast who wants to contribute, you've come to the right place.

## How It Works

The Chicken API is designed to be a community-driven resource. Here's a quick overview of how it works:

- **Get Chicken and Breed Data:** You can easily retrieve information about various chicken breeds and individual chickens through our API endpoints.
- **Suggest a New Breed or Chicken:** Want to add a new breed or your own chicken to the API? You can submit your suggestions through a `POST` request.
- **Review Process:** All submissions are added to a review queue. Our team manually reviews each submission to ensure accuracy and appropriateness.
- **Promotion to Main App:** Once a submission is approved, it's promoted to the main application and becomes available to all users.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of all kinds! Here are a few ways you can help:

- **Submit a Pull Request:** Have a new feature in mind? Want to fix a bug? We'd love to see your pull requests.
- **Create an Issue:** Found a bug or have an idea for a new feature? Open an issue and let's discuss it.
- **Suggest a New Breed or Chicken:** Have a favorite breed that's not in our database? Want to add your own chicken? We'd love to see your suggestions.
- **Improve Documentation:** See a way to make our documentation clearer? We appreciate all documentation improvements.

## Logging

The application uses [kotlin-logging](https://github.com/MicroUtils/kotlin-logging) with Logback. Log messages include a `requestId` for correlation and are written in plain text locally and JSON in production.

Adjust log levels in `application.properties` or via the `logging.level` system property, e.g.:

```properties
logging.level.co.qwex=DEBUG
```

## Using the API

The Chicken API is free and easy to use. Check out our [API Documentation](https://chickenapi.com/swagger-ui/index.html) to get started. We're excited to see what you build!
